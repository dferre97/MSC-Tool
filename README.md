## Week 4

- [x] Alternative equivalent definition of mailbox MSC
- [x] Definition of existentially k causally ordered bounded MSC
- [x] Decidability of synchronicity problem for Ek-co-bounded MSCs  
- Rationalize content and find a suitable order of presenting different arguments:
  - [x] High level overview of communication architectures (inspired by [8])
  - [x] Definition of asynchonous MSC
  - [x] Hierarchy of the considered MSC classes

## Week 5
- Todo:
  - [x] New definition of MSO logic over asynchronous MSCs
  - [x] New definition of mailbox existentially k-bounded using the general notion of k-bounded linearization
  - [x] Give MSO formulas for: p2p MSCs, mb MSCs, co MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded p2p MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded co MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded mb MSCs
  - [x] Give MSO formulas for: <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded p2p MSCs, <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded co MSCs, <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded mb MSCs
  - [ ] Rewrite Fact 2 of cuncur paper to include asynchronous communication (should already work).
  - [ ] Prove decidability of synchronicity problem for weakly k-synchronous, $\exists k$-bounded, and $\forall k$-bounded.
- To ask:
  - [ ] Ask Laetitia an opinion on $\exists k$-bounded special treewidth proof in [2] (Lemma 5.37)... does it work for asynchronous MSCs? I think so!
