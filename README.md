## Week 5
- Todo:
  - [x] New definition of MSO logic over asynchronous MSCs
  - [x] New definition of mailbox existentially k-bounded using the general notion of k-bounded linearization
  - [x] Give MSO formulas for: p2p MSCs, mb MSCs, co MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded p2p MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded co MSCs, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded mb MSCs
  - [x] Give MSO formulas for: <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded p2p MSCs, <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded co MSCs, <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded mb MSCs
  - [ ] Rewrite Fact 2 of cuncur paper to include asynchronous communication (should already work).
  - [ ] Prove decidability of synchronicity problem for weakly k-synchronous, <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded, and <!-- $\forall k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cforall%20k">-bounded.
- To ask:
  - [ ] Ask Laetitia an opinion on <!-- $\exists k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cexists%20k">-bounded special treewidth proof in [2] (Lemma 5.37)... does it work for asynchronous MSCs? I think so!

## Week 6
-  Existentially and universally k-bounded MSO-definability of the previous week was wrong, the binary relation for k-boundness does not make sense for the asynchronous case... 
- [X] New binary relation for k-boundness that should make sense for the asynchronous case, but I think it is not MSO-definable...
- [X] 1-n MSCs definition and MSO-definability
- [X] Relation between 1-n and causally ordered MSCs
- [ ] Relation between 1-n and mailbox MSCs?
- [ ] Should I provide a clear semantics for CFSA with bag channels (FIFO is assumed in the classic description)?
  
## Week 7
- 1-n:
  - [X] Relation between 1-n, causally ordered MSCs, and mailbox MSCs
  - [X] MSO-definability
- n-n:
  - [X] Definition
  - Conjecture on relation between n-1 and n-n

## Week 8
- [X] n-n is strictly contained in 1-n, found example of MSC that is 1-n, but not n-n! (thank you Laetitia <3)
- [X] Prepare presentation for Bolling, Finkel, Suresh

## Week 9
- Preliminary results for the decidability of synchronizability do not work with 1-n, because <!-- $L_{n-1}(S)$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_%7Bn-1%7D(S)"> is not prefix-closed :'(
  - [X] Rewritten preliminary results for 1-n (informally), so that MSO-definability and SWT-boundness still imply decidability of synchronizability.
- [X] MSO-definability of n-n
  
## Week 10
- [ ] Preliminary results for the decidability of synchronizability for 1-n and n-n
- [ ] Write MSO formulas for n-n classes
- [ ] Look into RSC communication model
