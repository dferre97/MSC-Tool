\paragraph*{Transitive Closure}
\davide{Wrong definition, change with Lozes'}
Given a set $\Sigma$ and binary relation $\to \subseteq \Sigma \times \Sigma$ that is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive (i.e., $\to$ is a strict partial order), we can express its reflexive transitive closure $\to^*$ in MSO as
\[
x \to^* y = \exists X.(x \in X \wedge y \in X \wedge 
\forall z.(z \in X \implies z=y \;\vee\; 
\exists k.(k \in X \wedge z \to k)))
\]

\paragraph*{Acyclicity} 

Given a binary relation $\to$, the acyclicity of $\to$ can be expressed with an MSO formula. Recall that, given a binary relation $\to$, it is acyclic if and only if its transitive closure $\to^+$ is antisymmetric. The MSO formula of acyclicity directly follows from this definition:
\[
\Phi_{acyclic} =  \neg \exists x.\exists y.(x \to^+ y \;\wedge\; y \to^+ x).
