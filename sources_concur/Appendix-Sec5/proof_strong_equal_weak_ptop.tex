Proof of the property from Remark~\ref{rem:stronglykp2p}:
\begin{restatable}{proposition}{strongequalweakptop}
\label{proposition:strong_equal_weak_p2p}
%	A \pp MSC is \skSo{k} iff it is \wkSo{k}.
Consider an MSC of the form
$\msc = \msc_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \msc_n$ %(with $\msc_i$ an MSC)
such that every MSC $\msc_i = (\Events_i,\procrel_i,\lhd_i,\lambda_i)$ is a ($k$-)exchange.
Then, for all $(e,f) \in {\le}_\msc$, there are $1 \le i \le j \le n$
such that $e \in \Events_i$ and $f \in \Events_j$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{proof}
%	$\Rightarrow$ By definition.
%%\alain{I change the direction of implications}
%
%	$\Leftarrow$ Let $\msc \in \MSCs$ such that $\msc$ is \wkSo{k}.
%	By contradiction, suppose that $\msc$ is not \skSo{k}. Then:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item either there is no decomposition such that $M = M_1 \cdots M_n$, $M_i$ is a \kE{k}, $1 \le i \le n$, and so $M$ cannot be \wkSo{k}, which is a contradition;
%		\item or there is $e \le_M f $ such that $e \in \Events_i, f \in \Events_j$, $i>j$. If $ e \le_M f$, either $e \lhd f$ and so $i = j$, or there is $ p \in \procSet$ such that $e \rightarrow_p f$ and $e$ appears always before $f$ on $p$ thus $i \le j$, and so we have a contradiction. \qedhere
%	\end{itemize}
%	%\qed
If $e \le_\msc f$, then there is a sequence of events $e = e_0 \bowtie_1 e_1 \bowtie_2 \ldots
\bowtie_m e_m = f$ where $\bowtie$ is either $\to$ or $\lhd$. Clearly, for every
$\ell \in \{0,\ldots,m-1\}$, there are $1 \le i \le j \le n$
such that $e_\ell \in \Events_i$ and $e_{\ell+1} \in \Events_j$.
By transitivity, this proves the statement.
