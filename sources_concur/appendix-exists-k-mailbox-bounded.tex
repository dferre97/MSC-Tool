\begin{proof}
Let $k\geq 1$ be fixed.
Since every existentially k-mailbox-bounded MSCs is also
existentially k-p2p-bounded, and since the class of existentially k-p2p-bounded MSCs is STW bounded (cf Proposition~\ref{prop:exists-k-p2p-bounded}),
the class of existentially k-mailbox-bounded MSCs is also STW bounded.

Let us show that it is moreover MSO definable.
%\comEtienne{we could also prove that it is FO definable with the same trick as in the p2p case. Maybe it is important complexity wise?}

By Lemma~\ref{lem:exists-k-mailbox-acyclicity-condition}, it is
enough to show that the acyclicity of $\preceq_M\cup\revb$ is
MSO definable, and since $\preceq_M$ was already shown MSO definable
and acyclicity is easily MSO definable, it is enough to show
that $\revb$ is MSO definable. It is indeed the case, as demonstrated by
this formula
$$
\phi(r,s)=\exists r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n. r\procrel r_1\procrel r_2\procrel\dots
\procrel r_n \wedge s\lhd r_n.
$$

Finally, let us show that existentially k-mailbox-bounded is also LCPDL
definable. This follows from the following formulas:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\prec_M= & (\lhd+\procrel)^+
\\
R = & \langle\lhd^{-1}\rangle\top
\\
\xrightarrow{\tiny{\mbox{next R}}} = & (\procrel\wedge\test{\neg R})^*\cdot (\procrel\wedge \test{R})
\\
\revb= & (\xrightarrow{\tiny{\mbox{next R}}})^k.(\lhd)^{-1}.
\\
\Phi_{\exists k~\mbox{mb-bounded}}=&\neg\Exists\Loop{(\prec_M+\revb)^+}
\end{array}
$$

\end{proof}
