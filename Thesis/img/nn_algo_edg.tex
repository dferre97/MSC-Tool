\begin{example}
	Fig.~\ref{fig:nn_algo_ex} shows an example of $\nnsymb$-MSC and its EDG. We use it to show how the algorithm that builds a $\nnsymb$-linearization works. Note that, for convenience, not all the edges of the EDG have been drawn, but those missing would only connect events for which there is already a path is our drawing; these edges do not have any impact on the execution of the algorithm. We start by applying step 1 on the event $!5$, which has in-degree 0. The algorithm starts to build a linearization using $!5$ as the first event, and all the outgoing edges of $!5$ are removed from the EDG, along with the event itself. Now, $!1$ has in-degree 0 and we can apply again step 1. The partial linearization becomes $!5\;!1$. Similarly, we can then apply step 1 on $!2$ and $!3$ to get the partial linearization $!5\;!1\;!2\;!3$. At this point, step 1 and 2 cannot be applied, but we can use step 3 on $?5$, which gets added to linearization. We then apply step 3 also to $?1$ and $?2$, followed by step 1 on $!4$, step 2 on $!6$ (which is an unmatched send event), and step 3 on $?3$ and $?4$. Finally, all the events of the MSC have been added to our linearization, which is $!5\;!1\;!2\;!3\;?5\;?1\;?2\;!4\;!6\;?3\;?4$. Note that this is a $\nnsymb$-linearization.
