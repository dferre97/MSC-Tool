\paragraph*{Transitive Closure}
Given a binary relation $\to$, we can express its reflexive transitive closure $\to^*$ in MSO as
\[
x \to^* y = \forall X.(x \in X \wedge forward\_closed(X)) \implies y \in X
\]
\[
forward\_closed(X) = \forall z.\forall t.(z \in X \wedge z \to t) \implies t \in X
\]

\paragraph*{Acyclicity} 

Given a binary relation $\to$, the acyclicity of $\to$ can be expressed using an MSO formula. Recall that, given a binary relation $\to$, it is acyclic if and only if its transitive closure $\to^+$ is antisymmetric. The MSO formula of acyclicity directly follows from this definition:
\[
\Phi_{acyclic} =  \neg \exists x.\exists y.(x \to^+ y \;\wedge\; y \to^+ x).
