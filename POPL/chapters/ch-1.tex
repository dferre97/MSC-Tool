In synchronous communication (also known as rendezvous communication), send and receive events are  viewed as a single entity, i.e., a receive event  happens simultaneously with its corresponding send. The  idea behind (fully) asynchronous communication, instead, is to decouple send and receive events, so that a receive event can happen indefinitely after its corresponding send. Depending on some additional constraints on those events, we can obtain new communication models that sit somewhere between synchronous and fully asynchronous communication. 
In this paper we try to clarify and classify those communication models
