% \section{(7) Hierarchy of classes of MSCs}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:com_models_overview}, the classes of MSCs for all the 7 communication models that we presented form a clear hierarchy, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:msc_hierarchy_full}. In this section we will provide proofs to support this claim. 

\medskip

First of all, note that every $\oneone$ MSC in an asynchronous MSC by definition. Moreover, Fig.~\ref{fig:fully_asy_ex} shows an example of MSC that is asynchronous but not $\oneone$, hence we have $\ppMSCs \subset \asMSCs$. We saw that in the $\none$ communicating model any two messages sent to a process $q$ must be received in the same order as they are sent. In the $\oneone$ communication model we have the same constraint, but only for messages sent by a same process $p$. It is easy to see that $\none$ communication is a special case of $\oneone$ communication, and so every $\onen$ MSC is also a $\oneone$ MSC. Besides, Fig.~\ref{fig:co_ex} shows a $\oneone$ MSC which is not a $\none$ MSC. In particular, note that $!1 \le !3$, but $!3 \mbrel !1$ since $?3 \procrel ?1$; $\preceq$ is then cyclic, i.e. not a partial order, and the MSC is not $\none$. It follows that $\mbMSCs \subset \ppMSCs$. A very similar reasoning can be made for the $\onen$ communication model, hence $\onenMSCs \subset \ppMSCs$. We now show that each $\none$ MSC is a causally ordered MSC.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:mb_is_co}
	Every $\none$ MSC is a causally ordered MSC.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\msc$ be a $\none$ MSC and $\linrel$ a $\none$ linearization of it. Recall that a linearization has to respect the happens-before partial order over $\msc$, i.e. $\le_\msc \,\subseteq\, \linrel$. Consider any two send events $s$ and $s'$, such that $\lambda(s)=\pqsAct{\plh}{q}$, $\lambda(s')=\pqsAct{\plh}{q}$ and $s \le_\msc s'$. Since $\le_\msc \,\subseteq\, \linrel$, we have that $s \linrel s'$ and, by the definition of $\none$ linearization, either
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	\item $s' \in \Unm{\msc}$, or 
	\item $s,s' \in \Matched{\msc}$, $s \lhd r$, $s' \lhd r'$ and $r \linrel r'$. 
\end{enumerate*}
The former clearly respects the definition of causally ordered MSC, so let us focus on the latter. Note that $r$ and $r'$ are two receive events executed by the same process, hence $r \linrel r'$ implies $r \procrel^+ r'$. It follows that $\msc$ is a causally ordered MSC.
\end{proof}

Fig.~\ref{fig:co_not_none} shows an example of causally ordered MSC that is not $\none$. It is causally ordered because we cannot even find two messages, addressed to the same process, such that the corresponding send events are causally related; on the contrary, the MSC is not $\none$ because we have $!4 \mbrel !1$ and $!2 \mbrel !3$, which lead to a cyclic dependency, e.g. $!1 \procrel !2 \mbrel !3 \procrel !4 \mbrel !1$.

The relation between $\onen$ and $\none$ MSCs is not as straghtforward as those seen so far. For convenience, we will start by only considering MSCs without unmatched messages. 

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:onen_mb_no_unmatched}
	Every $\onen$ MSC without unmatched messages is a $\none$ MSC.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We show that the contrapositive is true, i.e. if an MSC is not mailbox (and it does not have unmatched messages), it is also not $\onen$. Suppose $\msc$ is an asynchronous MSC, but not mailbox. There must be a cycle $\xi$ such that  $e \preceq e$, for some event $e$. Recall that ${\preceq} = ({\procrel} \,\cup\, {\lhd} \,\cup\, {\mbrel})^\ast$ and ${\le} = ({\procrel} \cup {\lhd})^\ast$. We can always explicitely write a cycle $e \preceq e$ only using $\mbrel$ and $\le$. For instance, there might be a cycle $e \preceq e$ because we have that $e \mbrel f \le g \mbrel h \mbrel i \le e$. Consider any two adiacent events $s_1$ and $s_2$ in the cycle $\xi$, where $\xi$ has been written using only $\mbrel$ and $\le$, and we never have two consecutive $\le$\footnote{This is always possible, since $a \le b \le c$ is written as $a \le c$.}. We have two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $s_1 \mbrel s_2$. We know, by definition of $\mbrel$, that $s_1$ and $s_2$ must be two send events and that $r_1 \procrel^+ r_2$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the receive events that match with $s_1$ and $s_2$, respectively (we are not considering unmatched messages by hypothesis).
	\item $s_1 \le s_2$. Since $\msc$ is asynchronous by hyphotesis, $\xi$ has to contain at least one $\mbrel$\footnote{If that was not the case, $\le$ would also be cyclic and $\msc$ would not be an asynchronous MSC.}; recall that we also wrote $\xi$ in such a way that we do not have two consecutive $\le$. It is not difficult to see that $s_1$ and $s_2$ have to be send events, since they belong to $\xi$. We have two cases:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $r_1$ is in the causal path, i.e. $s_1 \lhd r_1 \le s_2$. In particular, note that $r_1 \le r_2$.
		\item $r_1$ is not in the causal path, hence there must be a message $m_k$ sent by the same process that sent $s_1$, such that $s_1 \procrel^+ s_k \lhd r_k \le s_2 \lhd r_2$, where $s_k$ and $r_k$ are the send and receive events associated with $m_k$, respectively. Since messages $m_1$ and $m_k$ are sent by the same process and $s_1 \procrel^+ s_k$, we should have $r_1 \onenrel r_k$, according to the $\onen$ semantics. In particular, note the we have $r_1 \onenrel r_k \le r_2$.
	\end{enumerate}
	In both case (a) and (b), we conclude that $r_1 \lessdot r_2$. Recall that ${\lessdot} = ({\procrel} \,\cup\, {\lhd} \,\cup\, {\onenrel_\msc})^\ast$.
\end{enumerate}
Notice that, for either cases, a relation between two send events $s_1$ and $s_2$ (i.e. $s_1 \mbrel s_2$ or $s_1 \le s_2$) always implies a relation between the respective receive events $r_1$ and $r_2$, according to the $\onen$ semantics. It follows that $\xi$, which is a cycle for the $\preceq$ relation, always implies a cycle for the $\lessdot$ relation\footnote{If $\lessdot$ is cyclic, $\msc$ is not a $\onen$ MSC.}, as shown by the following example. Let $\msc$ be a non-mailbox MSC, and suppose we have a cycle $s_1 \mbrel s_2 \mbrel s_3 \le s_4 \mbrel s_5 \le s_1$. $s_1 \mbrel s_2$ falls into case (1), so it implies $r_1 \procrel^+ r_2$. The same goes for $s_2 \mbrel r_3$, which implies $r_2 \procrel^+ r_3$. $s_3 \le s_4$ falls into case (2), and implies that $r_3 \lessdot r_4$. $s_4 \mbrel s_5$ falls into case (1) and it implies $r_4 \procrel^+ r_5$. $s_5 \le s_1$ falls into case (2) and implies that $r_5 \lessdot r_1$. Putting all these implications together, we have that $r_1 \procrel^+ r_2 \procrel^+ r_3 \lessdot r_4 \procrel^+ r_5 \lessdot r_1$, which is a cycle for $\lessdot$. Note that, given any cycle for $\preceq$, we are always able to apply this technique to obtain a cycle for $\lessdot$.
\end{proof}

The opposite direction is also true and the proof, which can be found in the appendix, uses the same technique to prove that a cycle for $\lessdot$ always implies a cycle for $\preceq$.

\begin{restatable}{proposition}{mbonennounmatched} 
\label{prop:mb_onen_no_unmatched}
	Every $\none$ MSC without unmatched messages is a $\onen$ MSC.
\end{restatable}

Interestingly enough, Prop.\ref{prop:onen_mb_no_unmatched} and \ref{prop:mb_onen_no_unmatched} show that the classes of $\none$ and $\onen$ MSCs are effectively equivalent if we do not allow unmatched messages. As we will prove, this will change when we add unmatched messages into the mix. However, Proposition~\ref{prop:onen_mb_no_unmatched} still holds.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:onen_mb_unmatched}
	Every $\onen$ MSC is a $\none$ MSC, i.e. $\onenMSCs \subseteq \mbMSCs$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\msc$ be an asynchronous MSC. The proof proceeds in the same way as the one of Proposition~\ref{prop:onen_mb_no_unmatched}, but unmatched messages introduce some additional cases. Consider any two adiacent events $s_1$ and $s_2$ in a cycle $\xi$ for $\preceq$, where $\xi$ has been written using only $\mbrel$ and $\le$, and we never have two consecutive $\le$. These are some additional cases:
\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
	\item $u_1 \mbrel s_2$, where $u_1$ is the send event of an unmatched message. This case never happens because of how $\mbrel$ is defined.
	\item $u_1 \le u_2$, where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are both send events of unmatched messages. Since both $u_1$ and $u_2$ are part of the cycle $\xi$, there must be an event $s_3$ such that $u_1 \le u_2 \mbrel s_3$. However, $u_2 \mbrel s_3$ falls into case (3), which can never happen.
	\item $u_1 \le s_2$, where $u_1$ is the send event of an unmatched message and $s_2$ is the send event of a matched message. Since we have a causal path between $u_1$ and $s_2$, there has to be a message $m_k$, sent by the same process that sent $m_1$, such that $u_1 \procrel^+ s_k \lhd r_k \le s_2 \lhd r_2$\footnote{Note that we can have $m_k = m_2$}, where $s_k$ and $r_k$ are the send and receive events associated with $m_k$, respectively. Since messages $m_1$ and $m_k$ are sent by the same process and $m_1$ is unmatched, we should have $s_k \onenrel u_1$, according to the $\onen$ semantics, but $u_1 \procrel^+ s_k$. It follows that if $\xi$ contains $u_1 \le s_2$, we can immediately conclude that $\msc$ is not a $\onen$ MSC.
	\item $s_1 \mbrel u_2$,  where $s_1$ is the send event of a matched message and $u_2$ is the send event of an unmatched message. Since both $s_1$ and $u_2$ are part of a cycle, there must be an event $s_3$ such that $s_1 \mbrel u_2 \le s_3$; we cannot have $u_2 \mbrel s_3$, because of case (3). $u_2 \le s_3$ falls into case (5), so we can conclude that $\msc$ is not a $\onen$ MSC.
\end{enumerate}
We showed that cases (3) and (4) can never happen, whereas cases (5) and (6) both imply that $\msc$ is not $\onen$. If we combine them with the cases described in Proposition~\ref{prop:onen_mb_no_unmatched} we have the full proof.
\end{proof}

The MSC in Fig.~\ref{fig:mb_no_onen} shows a simple example of an MSC with unmatched messages that is $\none$ but not $\onen$. This, along with Prop.~\ref{prop:onen_mb_unmatched}, effectively shows that $\onenMSCs \subset \mbMSCs$.

\medskip 

In the $\nn$ communication model, any two messages must be received in the same order as they are sent. It is then easy to observe that each $\nn$ MSC is a $\onen$ MSC, because each $\nn$ linearization is also a $\onen$ linearization. Moreover, Fig.~\ref{fig:onen_nn_rsc_ex}a shows an example of MSC that is $\onen$ but not $\nn$, hence we have that $\nnMSCs \subset \onenMSCs$; in particular, note that for messages $m_1$ and $m_4$ we have $!1 \le !4$ and $?4 \procrel ?1$, so there cannot be a $\nn$ linearization, but it is possible to find a $\onen$ linearization such as $!1\;!2\;?2\;!3\;?3\;!4\;?4\;?1$. In the synchronous communication model, every send event is immediately followed by its corresponding receive event. Synchronous communication is then clearly a special case of $\nn$ communication, and every $\rsc$ MSC is a $\nn$ MSC because a $\rsc$ linearization is always also a $\nn$ linearization. Besides, Fig.~\ref{fig:onen_nn_rsc_ex}b shows an example of MSC that is $\nn$ but not $\rsc$, as a consequence we get hence $\rscMSCs \subset \nnMSCs$.
