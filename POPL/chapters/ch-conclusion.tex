We presented seven different communication models and formally defined the corresponding classes of MSCs, which represent valid computations for a given model. We then characterized each of these classes with MSO logic, going through some alternative definitions. Next, we showed how these classes form a non-sequential hierarchy of communication models. These results were then applied to deal with (un)decidability of some verification problems based on MSO.
