We studied seven different communication models
and their corresponding classes of MSCs, we characterized 
each of these classes with MSO logic, and draw the hierarchy of these communication models. These 
results were then applied to deal with (un)decidability of some 
verification problems. 

To refine the picture, we could
consider other logics like FO+TC or LCPDL, and other communication models, 
such as the FIFO-based implementation of the causally ordered 
communication model proposed in 
\cite{DBLP:conf/dagstuhl/MatternF94}, which we expect to sit somewhere between mailbox and causally ordered within the hierarchy that we presented. 
Moreover, as shown by Fig.~\ref{fig:stw-bound}, the 
decidability of the synchronizability problem for weakly 
synchronous MSCs and fully asynchronous communication is not entailed by our techniques, and could be studied in future works.
